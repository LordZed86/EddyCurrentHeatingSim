Eddy Current Heat Estimator

This Python script estimates the heat generated in a nickel sample due to eddy currents caused by a rotating magnetic disc. It is designed to help analyze and predict the temperature increase in water placed above the disc over a given time period (e.g., 5 minutes), based on disc RPM and magnetic field parameters.

üî¨ Project Overview

Eddy currents are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field. This script models the resulting Joule heating in a small nickel sample, which then transfers heat to surrounding water. The project aims to predict:
	‚Ä¢	The power generated via eddy currents.
	‚Ä¢	Temperature increase of the nickel sample.
	‚Ä¢	Estimated final water temperature after heat transfer.

This tool is ideal for physics experiments, educational demonstrations, and validating hypotheses in laboratory setups.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
	‚Ä¢	Input-driven modeling based on RPM, magnetic field strength, sample mass, and more.
	‚Ä¢	Calculates magnetic frequency, power from eddy currents, and heating over time.
	‚Ä¢	Estimates water temperature increase from energy transferred by nickel.
	‚Ä¢	Adjustable parameters for rapid experimentation and hypothesis testing.

üìö Background

This project was originally developed as part of a physics-for-engineering course experiment, where we constructed a makeshift eddy current induction stove. The setup involved:
	‚Ä¢	A power drill to spin a disc embedded with alternating polarity magnets,
	‚Ä¢	A nickel sample placed inside a glass beaker of water above the rotating disc.

The goal was to explore how rotational magnetic fields induce eddy currents in a conductor, resulting in resistive heating.

While the mathematical modeling in the script is theoretically sound and aligned well with electromagnetic theory, the experimental results highlighted two key limitations:
	1.	Insufficient RPM ‚Äî Our drill could not reach a high enough rotational speed to generate significant eddy currents using the relatively low-strength magnets we had available.
	2.	Thermal insulation ‚Äî The glass beaker acted as a thermal barrier, significantly reducing the amount of heat transferred from the nickel to the water.

As a result, the experiment served more as a proof of concept rather than a fully functional induction heater. Nevertheless, the project provided valuable insights into energy conversion, magnetic field dynamics, and the challenges of experimental heat transfer ‚Äî and the script remains useful for theoretical estimation, hypothesis testing, and instructional demonstrations.
